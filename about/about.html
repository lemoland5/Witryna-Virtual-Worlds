                        Introduction
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This page is my personal love letter to all of the amazing games I've played over the years which have helped me see just how much effort and care is put into their making
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The medium of video games is full of stunning environments either visually of design-wise; the prime examples being games featured on this ever-expanding list of case studies
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Games</h3>
                    <p>
                        Titles featured on this page - in my eyes - serve as perfect examples of their respective areas of world design
                        <br><br>
                        If a game is clever in its choice of landmarks, has well designed puzzles or perhaps a good progression arc it is a good candidate to be examined by me as a case study
                        <br><br>
                        Having nice graphics is not a necessity, <i>but it does help</i>, expecially in the modern world of triple-A games with their nigh-photorealistic visuals. That said, it would be easier for <i>Read Dead Redemption 2</i> to enter the list than it would be for <i>Pathologic</i>

                    <p>Your opinion is very important to me, if you have suggestions for future case studies, have noticed I haven't or just want to share your view on a particular part of a featured game, <b>let me know</b>
