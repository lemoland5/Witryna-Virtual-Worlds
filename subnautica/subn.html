                      Fauna in Subnautica can be found all over the planet, from the mysterious depths of the Crystal Caves to the vibrant Safe Shallows, and the fiery pits of the Lava Lakes. 
                      <br><br>
                      Fauna on Planet 4546B comes in all shapes, sizes, and forms. Ranging from the tiny, cave-dwelling Rockgrub, to the colossal Sea Dragon Leviathan that spews molten minerals from its mouth. Fauna on Planet 4546B is capable of enduring and adapting to various environments
                      <br><br>
                      In Subnautica additional scans after unlocking the Data Bank Entry for that particular species of Fauna alert the player as to whether or not the specimen is infected with the Kharaa virus infections.
                      <br><br>
                      The world is bursting with species and as such every corner is filled with beautiful and terrifying creatures. The world of Subnautica is designed in a way to reward observant players with unique encounters
