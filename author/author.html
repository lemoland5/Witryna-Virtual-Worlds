                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>
                        My name is Przemysław, I am 16 years old, I live in Gliwice and have a passion for computer games
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have always been interested in the <i>backstage</i> workings of things I encountered; how they are made and how they function, how they came to be and, most fascinatingly <b>how they were designed</b>



                    </p>

                    <h3>My work</h3>
                    <p>
                        Aside from this web project I have also worked in server development, software development and gamedev. Frontend is not my favorite, but it's <i>tolerable</i>
                        <br><br>
                        Though I find design a very deep and liberating process, websites are not my most beloved thing. I much prefer creating, designing and analising other topics - video games being one of them
                        <br><br>
                        On the more recent side - I have begun learning ReactJS and have so far been making pretty large strides, I find it pretty logical and enjoyable
                    </p>

                    <h3>Future projects</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here is a list of my future project ideas
                        <ul>
                            <li>- <strong>A website about my interests - <i>TOP PRIORITY</i></strong></li>
                            <li>- A 2D unity game caled Lab Rat - development ongoing</li>
                            <li>- A todo app using ReacjJS - training project</li>
                            <li>- A custom DBMS written in C++ - on hold
                            </li>
                            <li>- A self-aware AI that will wipe out humanity - on hold</li>
                            <li>- A cinema booking system - development ongoing</li>
                        </ul>
                        This list is always expanding, I'm always discovering new technologies and if something sparks my interest I tend to go somewhere with it
                        <br>Expect more projects to be added in the always-future ;)
